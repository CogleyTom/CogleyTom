- 👋 Hi, I’m @CogleyTom
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, programming, and watching TV or hanging out with my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++, Java, and Python. I am very new to GitHub and programming, so I am trying to learn. 
- 📫 How to reach me on here for now.

As stated above I am very new to GitHub and new to Programming as well. I am currently 30 years old and an Active Duty Sergeant in the Army. I have always been interested
in programming it just took awhile for me to go back to school. However, since I started I have loved every moment learning programming. There are many roadblocks I keep
encountering. I know if I keep pushing I will eventually perservere. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this.
